# The-Cuis-CookBook

**ATTENTION**. The new release of the CuisCookBook is written in Mediawiki and is [here](http://95.179.246.60/mediawiki/index.php/The_Cuis_Cookbook)

**CAVEAT**. I am moving the content these days. It is all very unstable. Still, one of the names that will point to the new CuisCookBook will be **cuiscookbook.euriscom.it** .
